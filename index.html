            <h2> Short Biography of Mother Teresa </h2>
            <p>
                Mother Teresa (1910–1997) was a Roman Catholic nun who devoted her life to serving the poor and
                destitute around the world. She spent many years in Calcutta, India where she founded the Missionaries
                of Charity, a religious congregation devoted to helping
                those in great need. In 1979, Mother Teresa was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and became a symbol of
                charitable, selfless work. In 2016, Mother Teresa was canonized by the Roman Catholic Church as Saint
                Teresa. <br> <br> <em><b> “It is not how much we do, <br> but how much love we put in the doing. <br> It
                        is not how much we give, <br> but how much love we put in the giving.”</b></em> <br> <br> –
                Mother Teresa. From: <u> No Greater Love </u>
                <br><br> Mother Teresa was born in 1910 in Skopje, the capital of the Republic of Macedonia. Little is
                known about her early life, but at a young age, she felt a calling to be a nun and serve through helping
                the poor. At the age of 18,
                she was given permission to join a group of nuns in Ireland. After a few months of training, with the
                Sisters of Loreto, she was then given permission to travel to India. She took her formal religious vows
                in 1931 and chose to be named
                after St. Therese of Lisieux – the patron saint of missionaries. <br> On her arrival in India, she began
                by working as a teacher; however, the widespread poverty of Calcutta made a deep impression on her, and
                this led to her starting a
                new order called “The Missionaries of Charity”. The primary objective of this mission was to look after
                people, who nobody else was prepared to look after. Mother Teresa felt that serving others was a
                fundamental principle of the teachings
                of Jesus Christ. She often mentioned the saying of Jesus, <br><br> “Whatever you do to the least of my
                brethren, you do it to me.”<br><br> As Mother Teresa said herself:<br><br> “Love cannot remain by itself
                – it has no meaning. Love has
                to be put into action, and that action is service .” – Mother Teresa<br><br> She experienced two
                particularly traumatic periods in Calcutta. The first was the Bengal famine of 1943 and the second was
                the Hindu/Muslim violence in 1946,
                before the partition of India. In 1948, she left the convent to live full-time among the poorest of
                Calcutta. She chose to wear a white Indian sari, with a blue border, out of respect for the traditional
                Indian dress. For many years, Mother
                Teresa and a small band of fellow nuns survived on minimal income and food, often having to beg for
                funds. But, slowly her efforts with the poorest were noted and appreciated by the local community and
                Indian politicians. In 1952, she
                opened her first home for the dying, which allowed people to die with dignity. Mother Teresa often spent
                time with those who were dying. Some have criticised the lack of proper medical attention, and their
                refusal to give painkillers.
                Others say that it afforded many neglected people the opportunity to die knowing that someone cared. Her
                work spread around the world. By 2013, there were 700 missions operating in over 130 countries. The
                scope of their work also expanded
                to include orphanages and hospices for those with terminal illnesses.<br><br> “Not all of us can do
                great things. But we can do small things with great love.”<br><br> - Mother Teresa
                <br><br> Mother Teresa never sought to convert those of another faith. Those in her hospices were given
                the religious rites appropriate to their faith. However, she had a very firm Catholic faith and took a
                strict line on abortion, the
                death penalty and divorce – even if her position was unpopular. Her whole life was influenced by her
                faith and religion, even though at times she confessed she didn’t feel the presence of God.<br><br> The
                Missionaries of Charity now has
                branches throughout the world including branches in the developed world where they work with the
                homeless and people affected by AIDS. In 1965, the organisation became an International Religious Family
                by a decree of Pope Paul VI.<br><br> In the 1960s, the life of Mother Teresa was brought to a wider
                public attention by Malcolm Muggeridge who wrote a book and produced a documentary called “Something
                Beautiful for God”.<br><br> In 1979, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize
                “for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat
                to peace.” She didn’t attend the ceremonial banquet but asked that the $192,000 fund be given to the
                poor.<br><br> In later years, she
                was more active in western developed countries. She commented that though the West was materially
                prosperous, there was often a spiritual poverty.<br><br> “The hunger for love is much more difficult to
                remove than the hunger for bread.”<br><br> - Mother Teresa
                <br><br> When she was asked how to promote world peace, she replied, ”Go home and love your
                family”.<br><br> Over the last two decades of her life, Mother Teresa suffered various health problems,
                but nothing could dissuade her from fulfilling
                her mission of serving the poor and needy. Until her very last illness she was active in travelling
                around the world to the different branches of The Missionaries of Charity. During her last few years,
                she met Princess Diana in the Bronx,
                New York. The two died within a week of each other.<br><br> Following Mother Teresa’s death, the Vatican
                began the process of beatification, which is the second step on the way to canonization and sainthood.
                Mother Teresa was formally
                beatified in October 2003 by Pope John Paul II. In September 2015, Pope Francis declared:<br><br>
                “Mother Teresa, in all aspects of her life, was a generous dispenser of divine mercy, making herself
                available for everyone through her welcome
                and defense of human life, those unborn and those abandoned and discarded. She bowed down before those
                who were spent, left to die on the side of the road, seeing in them their God-given dignity. She made
                her voice heard before the powers
                of this world, so that they might recognize their guilt for the crime of poverty they created.”<br><br>
                Mother Teresa was a living saint who offered a great example and inspiration to the world.
